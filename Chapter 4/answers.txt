Exercise 4.1

Q) what is the output of 5 + 10 * 20/ 2
A) 10 * 20 then /2 then + 5 = 105

Exercise 4.2.a
Q) parenthsise how c++ will interpret:
	* vec.begin()
	
A) * (vec.begin())

Exercise 4.2.b
Q) parenthsise how c++ will interpret:
	* vec.begin() + 1 
	
A) * (vec.brgin()) + 1

Exercise 4.4
Q) parenthsise how c++ will interpret:
	12 / 3 * 4 + 5  * 15 + 24 % 4  / 2 
	
A) (12 / (3 * 4)) + (5  * 15) + ((24 % 4)  / 2)
	output = 1 + 75 + (0/2)
		   = 76? or undefined
		   
Exercise 4.5.a
Q) Answer how c++ will output:
	-30 * 3 + 21 / 5 
	
A) output = -101 / 5
		  = -20 (fractional part truncates to 0)
	

Exercise 4.5.b
Q) Answer how c++ will output:
	-30 + 3 * 21 / 5 
	
A) 2 possibilities due to order of execution
	output = 33 / 5
		   = 6 (fractional part truncates to 0)
	OR
	output =  -30 + 12
		   = -18
	
Exercise 4.5.c
Q) Answer how c++ will output:
	30 / 3 * 21 % 5 
	
A) same precendence, output depends on order of execution
	output = 
		   = 6 (fractional part truncates to 0)
		      
Exercise 4.5.d
Q) Answer how c++ will output:	
	-30 / 3 * 21 % 4
	
A) same precendence, output depends on order of execution
	output = 
		   = 

Exercise 4.6
####SEE##### Exercise 4.6.cpp


Exercise 4.7 
Q) What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will
overflow.

A) 

Exercise 4.8
Q) Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND , logical OR , and equality operators.

A) the left operand is always evaluated 1st, for AND the 2nd operand is only evaluated if the 1st operand is true
	for OR the 2nd operand is evaluated if the 1st operand is false, in equality opearator, it's calculation is undefined

Exercise 4.9
Q) Explain the behavior of the condition in the following :

const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)

A) if statement evaluates as true as cp is a valid pointer thus evaluates as true/1 and *cp is also a non-zero
	value therefore both are ture/1 thus if (cp && *cp) is true
	
Exercise 4.10
Q) Write the condition for a while loop that would read ints
	from the standard input and stop when the value read is equal to 42.

A) 

int input;
while ((std::cin >> input) && input != 42)
	{
		// expression
	
	}


Exercise 4.11 
Q) Write an expression that tests four values, a, b, c, and d,
	and ensures that a is greater than b, which is greater than c, which is
	greater than d.
	
A) 		if (a > b && b > c && c > d)
		{
			//expression
		}


Exercise 4.12
Q) Exercise 4.12: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k means

A) since ">,<,== etc." are left-associative the expression reads as: i != (j < k)
	this means if j < k evluates to 1(true) then Second, i != true or i != false 
	is evaluated. Since i is an int, the bool will be converted to int, which means i != 1 or i != 0 is evaluated.
