Exercise 2.03
Q) What output will the following code produce?

unsigned u = 10, u2 = 42;
std::cout << u2 - u << std::endl;
std::cout << u - u2 << std::endl;
int i = 10, i2 = 42;
std::cout << i2 - i << std::endl;
std::cout << i - i2 << std::endl;
std::cout << i - u << std::endl;
std::cout << u - i << std::endl;

A) 
OUTPUT:
32
undefined
32
-32
0 (conversion warning maybe)
0 (conversion warning maybe)


Exercise 2.04
####  SEE ##############
Exercise 2.04.cpp 




Exercise 2.05
a) 'a' is of type char, L'a' is of type char but L makes modifies it to be a wide/long char
   "a" is a string literal?, L"a" is a wide/long string literal 

b) 10   is of type int (decimal)
   10u  is of type unsigned int (decimal)
   10L  is of type long (long int) (decimal)
   10uL is of type unsigned long (unsigned long int) (decimal) 
   012 	is of type octal - starts w/ 0 if 12 type 12?
   0xC is of type hexadecimal

c) 3.14  is of type double (remeber deafult for float)
   3.14f is of type float (single precision)
   3.14L is of type long double

d) 10    is of type int (decimal)
   10u   is of type unsigned int (decimal)
   10.   is of type double 
   10e-2 is of type double (exponential form) 

Exercise 2.06

int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;

Q) is there any difference in the above two definitions?
A) yes 2nd is treated as octal (which makes month = 09 invalid as no 9 in octal) whereas first is treated as decimal 
however there is no difference in value

Exercise 2.07
What values do these literals represent? What type does each have?

\..... = escape sequence
a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012" 
   CALCULATIONS (using ACII TABLE): \145  = e - 145 = octal , \012 = new line feed - 012 = octal
   "Who goes with Fergus? NEW LINE"
b) 3.14e1L
   31.4  long double
c) 1024f
   error: expects decimal point prior to 'f' suffix
d) 3.14L
   3.14  long double 


Exercise 2.08
Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain what’s wrong and how to correct it.

a) std::cin >> int input_value;       ILLEGAL - int input_value = 0; std::cin >> input_value; is acceptable
b) int i = { 3.14 };                  LEGAL - truncated to 3 or 3.14 isn't int change to float i.e double i = 3.14;
c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;    LEGAL - if you declared 'wage' before i.e. double wage;
d) int i = 3.14;                      LEGAL - truncated to 3 or see b)   


Exercise 2.10

Q) What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
    int local_int;
    std::string local_str;
}

A) global_int = 0 empty integer
   local_int  = undefined, is un-intilised and is undefined
   local_str  = '' empty string is defined by string class 

Exercise 2.11

Q) Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:


A)
a) extern int ix = 1024;   is a definition 
b) int iy;                 is a definition
c) extern int iz;          is a declaration

Exercise 2.12


Q) Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
a) int double = 3.14;                    invalid
b) int _;                                valid
c) int catch-22;                         invalid (due to -)
d) int 1_or_2 = 1;                       invalid
e) double Double = 3.14;                 valid (but confusing)


Exercise 2.13

Q) What is the value of j in the following program?

int i = 42;
int main()
{
    int i = 100;
    int j = i;
}

A) copy value of i into j ---> 100 local variable over-writes global variable

Exercise 2.14

Q)  Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?
  
int i = 100, sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
     sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;

A) Yes it's legal, since the for statement isn't a compound one including cout
   the output would be the sum of 1 to 9 = 45 

Exercise 2.15 

Q) Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?

A)
a) int ival = 1.01;           //valid but truncation occurs
b) int &rval1 = 1.01;         //invalid - can't address of operator with a number (intiliser must be an object)
c) int &rval2 = ival;         //valid if ival is declared/defined
d) int &rval3;                //invalid - address of what

Exercise 2.16   - confusing

Q) Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do

int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
 
A) 
a) r2 = 3.14159;        //valid - set d to 3.14159
b) r2 = r1;             //valid - sets r2 to r1 which 
c) i = r2;              //valid - truncation occurrs
d) r1 = d;              //valid - truncation occurs

Exercise 2.17

Q) What does the following code print?

int i, &ri = i;
i = 5; ri = 10;
std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;

A)
10 10 
i is a refference of r1 and r1 = 10

Exercise 2.18
Q) Write code to change the value of a pointer. Write code to change the value to which the pointer points.

A)

//code to change the value of a pointer
int main()
{
   int x = 0;
   int c = 10;
   int *ptr = &x;
   ptr = c;
return 0;
}


//code to change the value to which the pointer points
int main()
{
   int x = 0;
   int c = 10;
   int *ptr = &x;
   *ptr = c;
return 0;
}


Exercise 2.19

Q) Explain the key differences between pointers and references. definition:

A) the pointer is "points to" any other type.

   the reference is "another name" of an object.

key difference:
1. a reference is another name of an already existing object. a pointer is an object in its own right.
2. Once initialised, a reference remains bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to refer to a different object.
   A pointer can be assigned and copied.
3. a reference always get the object to which the reference was initially bound. a single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime.
4. a reference must be initialised. a pointer need not be initialised at the time it is defined.


Exercise 2.20

Q) What does the following program do?

int i = 42;
int *p1 = &i; *p1 = *p1 * *p1;

A)

defines i as 42, declares a pointer p1 and initialises it to be a reference of i, 
then does de-reference of p1 (i changes value) = value of p1 squared 
therefore i = 42 * 42 = 1764


Exercise 2.21

Q) Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.

int i = 0;

A)
a) double* dp = &i;    - invalid pointer must be same type as reference  
b) int *ip = i;        - illegal, cannot initialise a variable of type 'int *' with an lvalue of type 'int'
c) int *p = &i;        - valid - pointer p is a reference to i  


Exercise 2.22

Q) Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:

if (p) // ...
if (*p) // ...

A) 
tests whether p is nullptr?
tests if the pointer of p is empty (0)

Exercise 2.23

Q) Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object? If so, how? If not, why not?

A) no, need to see it's declaration and initialisation

Exercise 2.24

Q) Why is the initialization of p legal but that of lp illegal?

int i = 42;
void *p = &i;
long *lp = &i;

A)
void returns no value thus void and any other data type are compatible 
however the pointer of lp has a different type to that of i (int)

Exercise 2.25

Q) Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.

A)
a) int* ip, i, &r = i;       - all of type int, however ip isn't initialised (compiler warning?), i is an empty integer 
                               and r is a refference to i  
b) int i, *ip = 0;           - i is of type int but pointer ip is a null pointer
c) int* ip, ip2;             - ip is a null pointer, and ip2 is an empty integer


Exercise 2.26

Q) Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal, explain why.
const chapter part - implied that all variables are const

A)
a) const int buf;                 - invalid - const must have a value - must be initialised
b) int cnt = 0;                   - valid
c) const int sz = cnt;            - valid if cnt is a const, invalid if not
d) ++cnt; ++sz;                   - invalid can't write to const 


Exercise 2.27

Q) Which of the following initialisations are legal? Explain why.  (look up const pointers)

A)
a) int i = -1, &r = 0;                    - i is legal, r is illegal - null reference is illegal
b) int *const p2 = &i2;                   - legal 
c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;              - i is legal, r is illegal - null reference is illegal
d) const int *const p3 = &i2;             - legal if i2 is defined
e) const int *p1 = &i2;                   - legal if i2 is defined
f) const int &const r2;                   - illegal reference must be initialised, also invalid syntax for r2 const int & implies a const reference.
g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;              - both are is legal if i has been initalised 


Exercise 2.28

Q) Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal.

A)
a) int i, *const cp;                                  // empty integer i, cp illegal - must initialise
b) int *p1, *const p2;                                // pointer p1 of type int (points to int),  p2 illegal - must initialise, 
c) const int ic, &r = ic;                             // illegal - ic must be initialised 
d) const int *const p3;                               // p3 illegal - must initialise
e) const int *p;                                      // pointer p of type const int (points to const int)

Exercise 2.29

Q) Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why.


A) referes to Exercise 2.28 and each indivual question 
a) i = ic;                                             // illegal must initialise ic - legal apparently
b) p1 = p3;                                            // illegal - diff types of pointers
c) p1 = &ic;                                           // illegal - can't modify const
d) p3 = &ic;                                           // illegal - can't modify const
e) p2 = p1;                                            // illegal - can't modify const
f) ic = *p3;                                           // illegal - can't modify const

Exercise 2.30

Q) For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being declared has top-level or low-level const.

int i = 0;
const int * p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;        // p2 is a pointer to the address of v2, p3 is const pointer to address of i,r2 is a refference to v2, 


A)
const int v2 = 0;         v2 is a top level const
int v1 = v2;              v1 is neither
int *p1 = &v1;            p1 is a low level const
int &r1 = v1;             r1 is neither
const int *p2 = &v2;      p2 is a low level const
const int *const p3 = &i; p3 is a top level (due to *const pointer) and low const (implicit conversion of i to const?)
const int &r2 = v2;       r2 is a low level const

Exercise 2.31
Q) Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or
low-level const applies in each case.

A)
r1 = v2;                                               // legal - v2 is a top level const
p1 = p2;                                               // illegal - p2 is a low level const but p1 isn't
p2 = p1;                                               // legal - can convert int* to const int*
p1 = p3;                                               // illegal - p3 is a top level and low level const, p1 isn't a low level const 
p2 = p3;                                               // p3 is a top level const, p3 isn't copied into p2


Exercise 2.32
Q) Is the following code legal or not? If not, how might you make it legal?

int null = 0, *p = null;

A) illegal pointer - not how to set a null pointer

int null = 0, *p = nullptr;

Exercise 2.33 - check  - see exercise 2.34 for much clearer defintions etc. 

Q) Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens in each of these assignments:

A)
a = 42; // set 42 to int a.
b = 42; // set 42 to int b.
c = 42; // set 42 to int c.
d = 42; // 
e = 42; // 
g = 42; // error g is an reference

Exercise 2.35
Q) Determine the types deduced in each of the following definitions. Once you’ve figured out the types, write a program to see whether you were correct.

const int i = 42;
auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i; const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;

A) 


Exercise 2.36

Q) In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
++d;

A) 

Exercise 2.37

Q) Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;

A)
